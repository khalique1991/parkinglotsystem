Parking Lot System

An enterprise-level Parking Lot Management System built with Java 17, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and Microservices architecture (modular design).
The system manages vehicle entry/exit, reservations, payments, notifications, and reporting for multi-site parking facilities.

ðŸ”¹ Features

âœ… Multi-level parking lot management

âœ… Vehicle entry/exit session tracking

âœ… Reservation (pre-booking & cancellation)

âœ… Dynamic pricing & payment integration

âœ… User management with roles (Admin, Attendant, Customer)

âœ… Notifications (Email, SMS, Push)

âœ… Real-time occupancy monitoring

âœ… Reporting & analytics

ðŸ”¹ Architecture

This project follows a multi-module (Maven) architecture, which can later evolve into microservices.

ðŸ”¹ Getting Started
1. Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/parking-system.git
cd parking-system

2. Build Project
mvn clean install

3. Run Individual Module (example: reservation-service)
cd reservation-service
mvn spring-boot:run

4. Access API Docs

Each service exposes Swagger UI at:

http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

ðŸ”¹ Example Use Case Flow

Customer books a parking spot â†’ Reservation Service creates reservation.

Payment Service verifies and charges customer.

Notification Service sends booking confirmation.

On arrival, Session Service validates vehicle and opens gate.

On exit, session is closed â†’ final bill generated.

Reporting Service updates occupancy and revenue stats.

ðŸ”¹ Future Enhancements

AI-based parking spot recommendation

Integration with ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) cameras

Dynamic surge pricing

Multi-tenant support (franchise parking operators)

Mobile app (React Native/Flutter)

ðŸ‘‰ This shows domain relationships:

A ParkingLot has many ParkingSpots

A Reservation links Vehicle â†” Spot

Payment is tied to a Reservation
